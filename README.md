# CI-FirstResponders
CSCI 4970 Capstone

DistressML:
This is a python program named DistressDetector.py that contains various machine learning classification models that will be tested on the dataset as the dataset improves, until the optimal one is discovered with the near-final dataset, after which the automated response system will be implemented.

DataGenerator:
This is a python program that will generate the dataset being used for this project, which at the moment can produce a dataset with mostly realistic values, though it still needs some work before it is as realistic as it can be. Once it is complete, the output will be used to build the finalize ML model.
